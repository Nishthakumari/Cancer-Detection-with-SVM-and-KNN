# machine_learning_projects

This is a machine learning project during my undergraduate studies that focuses on breast cancer detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project includes the following steps:

Introduction: Provides an overview of breast cancer, its prevalence, and the importance of early detection.

Data Collection: Describes the dataset used for the project and explains the features of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing data, performs feature scaling, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

Feature Selection: Uses techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance to select relevant features for building the predictive models.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Implements SVM algorithm for breast cancer detection, explains its working, and tunes the hyperparameters for optimization.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implements KNN algorithm for breast cancer detection, explains its working.

Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the SVM and KNN models on the testing dataset.
